# Why

I made this bot becauase I was bored of Fortnite and I use discord literally 24/7 so I decided to make a bot. I started learning with youtube tutorials, then the https://discordjs.guide website, and eventually, i learned some basic javascript. So yeah; I was bored and I liked discord.

# If u wanna fork this

If you really want to fork this (idk why you would though because this is probably the worst code ever and every version has about 3875982756239845 commits), you install node.js, clone the forked repository into a new folder (ask google how), open a terminal, cd to that folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies, run `touch .env` to make a .env file, and in the .env file, do the following:

```
TOKEN=(yourtoken)
MONGOPATH=(yourmongopath)
```

I hope this helps!
